Steps:
1) Seperate the Oreo biscuits from the cream inside it. (Use about 36 biscuits to make a good sized cake)
2) Break the Oreo biscuits into small pieces and blend them together in a blender. Do this until the pieces become like mush.
3) Pour the now liquid-like pieces of the Oreos into a bowl and mix it continuously until it becomes fluid.
4) While doing this, add 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of sugar into the bowl and mix it. 
5) After this, take a cake-baking-tray and pour the mixture of the Oreos into it. Before doing this, rub a little bit of melted butter and flour onto the tray.
6) Put the tray into a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes.
7) During this time, you can mix the Oreo cream until it becomes liquid-like.
8) When the tray in the oven is ready you can pour the Oreo cream on it like icing.
